# Simulating the Asian Option
# ===========================
#
# Here we consider estimating the value of an Asian option
#
# $$
# \nu = \E\left[ \mathrm{e}^{-rT} (\bar{X}(T) - K)^+ \right]
# $$
#
# as described in Sect.~\ref{sec:fe}, where the maturity is $T = 1$
# year, the risk-free interest rate is $r = 0.05$ and the strike price
# is $K = \$55$. The underlying asset has an initial value of $X(0) =
# \$50$ and the volitility is $\sigma^2 = (0.3)^2$.  Recall that the
# key quantity is
# $$
# \bar{X}(T) = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T X(t)\, \D t
# $$
# the time average of a continuous-time, continuous-state geometric
# Brownian motion
# process which we cannot truely simulate on a digital computer.
# \index{geometric Brownian motion}
# Thus, we approximate it by dividing the
# interval $[0, T]$ into $m$ steps of size $\Delta t =
# T/m$ and using the discrete approximation
# $$
# \widehat{\bar{X}(T)} = \frac{1}{m}
# \sum_{i=1}^m X(i \Delta t) .
# $$
# This makes simulation possible, since
#
# $$
# X(t_{i+1}) = X(t_i) \exp\left\{\left( r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2
# \right)(t_{i+1}
# - t_i) + \sigma\sqrt{t_{i+1} - t_i} \, Z_{i+1} \right\}
# $$
#
# for any increasing sequence of times $\{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m\}$,
# where $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_m$ are i.i.d.\ $\mathrm{N}(0,1)$.
#
# Figure~\ref{fig:asian.sim} is VBASim code that uses $m=32$ steps in
# the approximation, and makes $10{,}000$ replications to estimate
# $\nu$. Discrete-event structure would slow execution without any
# obvious benefit, so a simple loop is used to advance time. The value
# of the option from each replication is written to Excel for
# post-simulation analysis.
#
# The estimated value of $\nu$ is \$2.20 with a relative error of just over 2\%
# (recall that the relative error is the standard error divided by the
# mean). As the histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:AsianHistogram} shows, the
# option is frequently worthless (approximately 68\% of the time), but
# the average payoff, conditional on the payoff being positive, is
# approximately \$6.95.
